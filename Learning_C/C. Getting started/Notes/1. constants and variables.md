# Constants and Variables

## Constants

- an entity that doesn't change
- more broadly, the value of a constant can't be changed

Types of constants in C

- Primary constants: Integer, float, and character 
- Secondary constants: Array, structures, pointers, Enum, etc
- e.g., 'A' is a constant character value

Declarationa and initialisation of constants

```c
#include<stdio.h>    
int main()
{    
    const float PI=3.14;    
    printf("The value of PI is: %f",PI);    
    return 0;  
}     
```

There is another way to define a constant ie by using the ```#define``` preprocessor, but we'll get into that [later](https://github.com/realKarthikNair/Learning-C-Lang/blob/main/Learning_C/J.%20Preprocessor/Preprocessor%20DIrectives/notes/preprocessor_directives.md#2-macros)
