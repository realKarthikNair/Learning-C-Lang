# Operators and Operator Precedence

### Operators are basically symbols(e.g, +, -, *) that tells the compiler to perform mathematical or logical functions

##### Operand: an operand is a term used to describe any object that is capable of being manipulated. For example, in "1 + 2" the "1" and "2" are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator.

- Arithmetic Operators

Consider A=10, B=20


|**Operator**| Purpose | Example | 
| :---:| :---:| :---: |
| + | Adds two operands| A+B=30 |
| - | Subtracts second operand from the first | A-B=-10|
| * | Multiplies both operands | A*B=200 |
| / | Divides numerator by denominator | B/A=2 |
| % (Modulus Operator) |  Remainder after an integer division | B%A=0|
| ++ (Increment operator) | Increases the integer value by one | A++=11|
| -- (Decrement operator) | Decreases the integer value by one | A--=9|

- Relational Operators 

Consider A=10, B=20


|**Operator**| Purpose | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not |
