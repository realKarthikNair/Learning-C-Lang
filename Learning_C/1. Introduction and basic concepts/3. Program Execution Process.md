# Program Execution Process

### Execution Flow

C program =>  Preprocessing => Expanded Source Code => Compiler => Assembly Code => Assembler => Object Code => Linker => Executable File => loader => Execution => Output

##### 1. Preprocessing

- During preprocessing, the [preprocess directives](https://github.com/realKarthikNair/Learning-C-Lang/blob/main/Learning_C/10.%20Preprocessor/Preprocessor%20DIrectives/notes/preprocessor_directives.md) are substituted with their original values which produces the *Expanded Source Code*

##### 2. Compilation

- Converts the Expanded Source Code into assembly code (still human readable, but closer to the hardware)
- Assembly code is unique to the target architecture

##### 3. Assembly

- Converts assembly code into object code 
- not readable by humans

##### 4. Linking

- Basically creates the executable binary
- .exe (for windows) or a.out (for linux)
