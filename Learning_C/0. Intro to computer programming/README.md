# The Bare Basics of computer programming!

- Computers naturally can only understand Binary - The language of zeroes and ones
- The word "Hello" would be "01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111" in binary, so giving a computer instructions in binary was never a feasible way
- To solve this, humans invented programming languages. Programming languages look more natural and readable to humans. 
- **Programming languages act as a communication medium between computers and programmers. The application programs made as the end-result using a programming language is inturn used by normal humans to get things done by computers. Yep, programmers aren't normal humans, we're basically sorcerers :-p**.
- Each programming language comes with a syntax, which is a set of rules that is used to write code in that particular language.

# How does a modern programming language work?

Code => Language Processors(translators) => Binary (Machine language)

# Types of programming languages

### 1. Low-level languages
- The most basic programming languages
- Two kinds : (1) Machine Language and (2) Assembly Language
- Machine Language : Mainly Made up of either 0s and 1s or other forms of numbers such as base16. They are faster than High-level languages since computers can understand it directly with little to no requirement of a translating program!
- Assembly Language : They are easier to read than Machine code and are designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. It requires less memory and has less execution time.
- **Low level languages are used in places such as the embedded industry (cars, IoT, medical), by chipset manufacturers etc where humans have the requirement to directly communicate with a specific type of processor/chipset for example**

### 2. Middle-level programming languages
- These languages aim to be more appealing and readable to humans while maintaining the speed and resource efficiency near to Low-level languages!
- C Language is a good example of a middle level language. 
- **Middle level languages can basically be used for anything but the most ideal cases they're widely used includes Operating System Development, Game Development, etc where speed and resource efficiency is a priority**

### 3. High-level programming languages
- These languages expand the boundaries of 'what is possible with your computer' by adding more features and ease in syntax 
- They are slower than low-level and middle-level languages since they require Language processors to translate programs into machine code that consume resources
- C++, Python, Kotlin are good examples of high level languages
- **Though use-cases of high level languages are highly dependant on the particular language, they're mainly used in Application Development, Web development, cybersecurity, R&D, etc where 'getting the word done faster' has a relatively higher priority than speed and resource efficiency.**
