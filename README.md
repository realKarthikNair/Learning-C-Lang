# Learning-C-Lang
Cuz Paulo Coelho once said- “And, when you want to learn the C programming language, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”

### Why this repo?
To save my progress learning C language during my time in the university

### Why go public?
Who knows it might end up helping the FBI!

### To anyone referring this repo
The contents of the repo that includes the notes and code files are solely subjective to my own understanding of the C programming language. That said, any errors etc are quite normal since I'm just a beginner to C and in such cases **you are encouraged to send a PR(Pull Request) to rectify the errors and thus make this repo even useful for me and the general public.**

### Resources I'm using to learn C (will be updated with time)
- My college lecturer, [Ms. Swati Jain](https://vsit.vips.edu/swati-jain/)
- "Let Us C" by Yashavant Kanetkar
- [Exercism](exercism.org)
- YouTube (no specific channels/playlists, i just search topics and choose kinda randomly)
