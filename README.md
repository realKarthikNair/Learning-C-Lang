# Learning-C-Lang
Cuz Paulo Coelho once said- “And, when you want to learn the C programming language, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”

### Why this repo?
- To save my progress learning the C programming language

### Why go public?
- To make the day seem brighter for beginners into the C programming language

### To anyone referring this repo
The contents of the repo that includes the notes and code files are solely subjective to my own understanding of the C programming language. That said, any errors etc are quite normal since (1)I'm just a beginner to C and (2)I'm a human and humans make mistakes. In such cases **you are encouraged to send a PR(Pull Request) to rectify the errors and thus make this repo even useful for me and the general public.**
