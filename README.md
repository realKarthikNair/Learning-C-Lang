# Learning-C-Lang
Cuz Paulo Coelho once said- “And, when you want to learn the C programming language, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”

### Why this repo?
To save my progress learning C language during my time in the university

### Why go public?
Who knows it might end up helping the FBI!

### To anyone referring this repo
The contents of the repo that includes the notes and code files are solely subjective to my own understanding of the C programming language. That said, any errors etc are quite normal since I'm just a beginner to C and in such cases **you are encouraged to send a PR(Pull Request) to rectify the errors and thus make this repo even useful for me and the general public.**

### Credits and resources i used to learn
(will add once i cover the basics completely)
